Holberton shell, or simply hsh, is a simple command line prompt that is made for a project at the end of the first trimester of Holberton School. It consists in a basic shell which can run programs and built-in commands.
ItÂ´s inspired in other shells like bash or sh but not with the best optimization. Besides, if you want to try it, you can clone the repo, compile it and give us your opinion .


# Example
`./hsh` Executes the shell and shows us the prompt (if is in interactive mode) waiting for an input.
<br>Output: `($) _`

# Features

 - Shows a prompt and wait the user enter a command. When a command ends the execution the prompt shows again.
 - Search for commands in the `PATH` directories (can execute commands with a absolute PATH).
 - Handle errors.
 - Handle end-of-file condition (Ctrl + D).
 - Handle comments `#`.
 - Handle commands with arguments.
 - Support built-in function exit with and without an status.
 - Handle the Ctrl + C condition to not kill the shell.
 - Support built-in function cd (only interactive mode).

## Built-in Functions

 - `exit [status]` exit the shell with exit code given in status.
